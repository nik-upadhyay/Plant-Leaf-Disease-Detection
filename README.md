# Plant-Leaf-Disease-Detection
<h3>Plant Leaf disease detection model using Python, CNN, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and other ML Algo</h3>
<p>
Plant leaf disease prediction using CNN for which we have used Convolutional Neural Network Model. The accuracy of our model is 92.54%. In this model, we used Tensorflow-enabled GPU, and techniques like prefetching, and caching to make computations faster and data augmentation and pooling to make our model more accurate and noise-resistant. Through the developed model, we discover the factors that predict whether a given picture of the plant has any specific disease or is a healthy plant, with an accuracy of 92.54
